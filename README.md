# influxdb-ui [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/danesparza/influxdb-ui.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/danesparza/influxdb-ui)
A simple UI for InfluxDB.  Now that [web admin UI has been removed](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.3/administration/differences/#web-admin-ui-removal) in version 1.3 and later releases, I thought it might still be nice to have a simple web UI to manage InfluxDB.

Built entirely in React/Flux.

## Building

yarn build
